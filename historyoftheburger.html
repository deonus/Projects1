<h2>Modern Day</h2>
As our <a href="ingrediants.html"> Ingrediants </a> pages lists, burger technology has come a long way since the humble beginings of <strong>raw, rancid, sweaty saddle meat</strong>
of the 1200's as well as the <strong> plain, tasteless </strong> sandwiches of the late 1800's.
